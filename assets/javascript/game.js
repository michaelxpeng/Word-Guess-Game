//Create an array of All-Stars

// Create variables for other wins counter, loss counter, guesses left counter

// Create empty arrays for computer's choice, underscores, guessed letters and incorrect guesses

// Create a boolean variable to check if the game is running

// Create variables that refer to DOM elements

// Create a function that starts/resets the game with starting values assigned

// Make computer randomly pick a name from the array of All-Stars

// Create corresponding amount of underscores to the selected name

// Send the information to DOM

// Create an event listener that takes starts the game when user clicks on the start button

// Create an event that takes user's guesses based on key entered

// Check to see if the guessed letter matches any of the 

// Check to see if the guessed letter is in computer's chosen name

// If so, swap out the corresponding underscore with the correct letter

// If the user tries to guess a letter already guessed, send an alert asking the user to pick a different letter

// Send the information to DOM

// If the user's guess is incorrect, amount of guesses decreases, the incorrect letter is added to the list of incorrect guesses

// Run a function to see if the user wins or loses

// Loss happens when the guesses left reaches 0

// If it's a loss, then end the game, add 1 to the loss counter, alert the user he/she lost, and show computer's choice

// If it's a win, then end the game, add 1 to the win counter and alert the user he/she won
